# WebTechProject
# This project is a one-page web application where users can share cross-stitch schemes for free. Anyone can add a new position with a title, short description (optional), topicId tag, difficultyEntity level and a link to a cloud drive where the images of the schemes and eventually the completed product are stored.
# While surfing on this page, one can switch between different topics (e.g. landscape, animals, people, architecture etc.) and specify which difficultyEntity level one is interested in.
# One can delete the position one previously made. For security reasons, one needs to enter the security code automatically generated upon the creation of a new position in order to delete it.
# This is a preliminary outline of the project, open for further changes.
